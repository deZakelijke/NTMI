    "### Preamble\n",
    "#### Please read this text carefully before beginning\n",
    "For the labs in this course, you should work with a partner, where the two of you share a single keyboard and screen. Each person needs to be responsible for making sure that both they and their partner understand what is going on. You should stay engaged with what your partner is doing and discuss what’s going on all times. That means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you know the answer and your partner doesn’t, _don’t_ just type it in and move on to the next question--- explain what you have done and why. This not only helps your partner to learn, but will also clarify your own understanding. Consider whether you could give other examples that would help your partner understand even better, and ask if they are satisfied with your explanation. Being able to think around a concept and explain it well to other people is an important skill to learn, and not always easy.\n",
    "- If your partner knows the answer and you don’t, _don’t_ let them move on until you understand too. And if you are at the keyboard, _don’t_ let them simply dictate what you should type if you don’t understand why. Do ask questions, and let your partner know if their explanation makes sense or not. Remember, just because they think they know the answer doesn’t necessarily mean they are right, and if it doesn’t make sense to you, they need to work harder at explaining (and maybe discover that they are wrong!)\n",
    "- If neither of you knows the answer, ask your TA, and they can try to help you.\n",
    "- If one person is much more familiar with Python than the other, consider putting the weaker person at the keyboard or at least switching frequently, so they will get more practice with basic coding skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coding guidelines\n",
    "Make an effort to write well-structured and well-commented code. Your grader should be able to understand your code without too much effort. One line of comment for every line of code is not too much - ideally, even a person who does not know the programming language should be able to understand what is going on based on your comments. Your grader is allowed to remove up to two points out of every ten points, if your code is not readable. \n",
    "\n",

    "### Required software\n",
    "Jupyter notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Easy installation**  The easiest way to get the required software is to install Anaconda. See https://www.continuum.io/downloads . It contains all required packages, including python and jupyter. You can choose python 2.7 or 3.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Manual installation** Make sure that you have numpy and matplotlib installed. If you don't, you can use e.g. pip install <package> --user (python2) or pip3 install <package> --user (python3).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission\n",
    "Please submit your jupyter notebook **as a pair via Blackboard**. The deadline for submission is **Friday 10 23:59**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Start the notebook\n",
    "Start a terminal, and cd into the directory where you saved the notebook. Then type jupyter notebook. Your web browser will open.\n",

    "This week's preamble is quite long. From next week, there will be less reading and more doing!\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is meant to help you get familiar with some language data, do some basic text-processing, and explore some concepts learnt in class. We will use two kinds of corpora in this exercise, the **Penn Treebank** corpus (newspaper text) and the **CHILDES** corpus (child language learning data), described below. For each of them,  take a few minutes to read the sentences/utterances before starting to program. Then, using Jupyter Notebook, write code to answer the given questions. We have included a number of additional (optional) questions at the end of in **Going Further**. If you finish the main questions, choose one of the additional ones to work on. **Total points: 10**\n",

This dataset is very commonly used to to train models in NLP systems. It also contains additional information like Part-of-Speech tags and syntactic trees, which has been removed for this exercise.
